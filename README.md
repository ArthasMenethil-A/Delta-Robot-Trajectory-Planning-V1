# Delta_Robot

 this will be a step by step demonstration of how to get started with the Delta robot

# step 1: THEORY

 1. first you'll need to know a bit of robotics(meaning what forward and inverse kinematics are)
    for that you can use this youtube play list:

 2. after you get to know how FK and IK work, you should be able to derive these for the Delta pick-n-place robot, for IK you can

    also there is what i used: "theory\Inverse Kinematics (Delta Robot).pdf"

 3. 

# step 2: PYTHON IMPLEMENTATION 

 1. Inverse kinematics:
   you'll find this in "python implementations\trajectory_planning_345.py" lines of
