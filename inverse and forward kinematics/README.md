# INVERSE KINEMATICS METHOD 1
![IK](https://i.ibb.co/rGhpdxH/Cam-Scanner-08-18-2022-20-51.jpg)
in the python code i've written ```base_radius``` and ```EE_radius``` as the variables but they are not really the radius, they are the triangle sides (shown in the figure above) the method 2 also have this problem

# INVERSE KINEMATICS METHOD 2
in [this file]() ```get_theta_ij()``` method, returns the IK answer which is $\theta$ of the actuator joints

# FORWARD KINEMATICS
